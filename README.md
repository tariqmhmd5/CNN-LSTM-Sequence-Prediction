Problem Statement

we should give a sequence of number to the model and the model should be able to predict the class of the input, we have 6 class.
for example, if we have
5 ->1 ->4 = it is decremental followed by incremental and it belongs to one of the classes.

1- Develop a LSTM model, but the input is a sequence of images with their label, it is taken from the Mnist dataset.

2- Develop a CNN for the same dataset.

3- Develop a LSTM+CNN for the same dataset,


a. we have to compare them base on the f1 scores, confusion matrix, and accuracy.

b. show train and validation loss for each model.
